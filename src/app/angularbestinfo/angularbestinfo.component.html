<p><strong>1. Enterprise-Grade Framework</strong><br>
    Angular is a full-fledged framework with everything built-in (routing, HTTP client, form handling, etc.). It's designed for large-scale, enterprise applications like those in the insurance domain.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. TypeScript by Default</strong><br>
    Angular uses TypeScript, which provides static typing and better tooling (autocompletion, refactoring, error detection). Helps maintain large codebases with multiple developers over time.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Structured Architecture</strong><br>
    Angular enforces a clear project structure and best practices. Ideal for enterprise teams that need consistent architecture and scalability.</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Powerful Reactive Forms</strong><br>
    Angular's Reactive Forms module is great for building complex, dynamic forms with validation, dynamic fields, and custom logic.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Advanced Dependency Injection</strong><br>
    Angular has a robust dependency injection system out of the box, which makes it easy to manage services and state.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6. Built-in Routing & Guards</strong><br>
    Comes with RouterModule for complex routing, lazy loading (application fast loading), route guards (for user role access, security), etc. Essential for role-based dynamic dashboards and menus.</p>
    
    <p><strong>7. Rich Ecosystem and Tooling</strong><br>
    Integrated tooling via the Angular CLI (code generation, linting, testing, production builds). Better suited for CI/CD pipelines in enterprise projects.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8. Strong Community & Long-Term Support</strong><br>
    Backed by Google, Angular has long-term support (LTS) and wide adoption in enterprise sectors (banking, insurance, healthcare).</p>
    
    <p><strong>9. Server-Side Pagination & DataTables</strong><br>
    Angular integrates smoothly with libraries like AG Grid, ngx-datatable, PrimeNG—many of which support server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering out of the box.</p>
    
    <p><strong>10. Better for Teams & Large Applications</strong><br>
    Angular’s strict patterns make it easier to onboard new developers and maintain the code quality in large teams and long-term projects.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
    Ideal for complex web apps. <br>Easy to maintain code and easy to scale to add new features over time.</p>

    <p><strong>Interceptor is strong point to hanlde all request payload, response from one file.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>New Signal feature helps to commincate between large components. Strong in data reactivity due to this we can avoid need of store to handle state.
        As we can avoid store, our app build size will be minimum to save loading time and memory
