1. Enterprise-Grade Framework
   Angular is a full-fledged framework with everything built-in (routing, HTTP client, form handling, etc.).
   It's designed for large-scale, enterprise applications like those in the insurance domain.

2. TypeScript by Default
   Angular uses TypeScript, which provides static typing and better tooling (autocompletion, refactoring, error detection).
   Helps maintain large codebases with multiple developers over time.

 3. Structured Architecture
    Angular enforces a clear project structure and best practices.
    Ideal for enterprise teams that need consistent architecture and scalability.

 4. Powerful Reactive Forms
    Angular's Reactive Forms module is great for building complex, dynamic forms with validation, dynamic fields, and custom logic.

 5. Advanced Dependency Injection
   Angular has a robust dependency injection system out of the box, which makes it easy to manage services and state.

 6. Built-in Routing & Guards
    Comes with RouterModule for complex routing, lazy loading(application fast loading), route guards (for user role access, security), etc.
    Essential for role-based dynamic dashboards and menus.

 7. Rich Ecosystem and Tooling
    Integrated tooling via the Angular CLI (code generation, linting, testing, production builds).
    Better suited for CI/CD pipelines in enterprise projects.

8. Strong Community & Long-Term Support
  Backed by Google, Angular has long-term support (LTS) and wide adoption in enterprise sectors (banking, insurance, healthcare).

9. Server-Side Pagination & DataTables
  Angular integrates smoothly with libraries like AG Grid, ngx-datatable, PrimeNG—many of which support server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering out of the box.

10. Better for Teams & Large Applications
Angular’s strict patterns make it easier to onboard new developers and maintain the code quality in large teams and long-term projects.
